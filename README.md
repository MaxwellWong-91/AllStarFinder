# NBA All Star Finder

Collected data from basketball-reference.com to use as training data for a KNeighborsClassifier. Used trained model on players from the 2018-2019 NBA season, which found that my model had a 97% accuracy rating. Set up a website using django and react that would allow users to interact with my trained model and predict whether a hypothetical player would be considered an all star in my model. Created over 500 api endpoints that displayed the results of my models prediction on the 2018-2019 NBA roster along with the player's statas that year.

A version without the api endpoints can be found here. https://allstarpredictor.herokuapp.com/.
